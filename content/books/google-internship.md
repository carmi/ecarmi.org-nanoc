How do you get a software engineering internship at Google? If you read this
book, can I promise that Google will hire you? Of course not!  There is no
quick trick to getting great internships.

But the programming world is different from other industries. Your ability to
solve problems, learn, and create is more important than anything else. A
Computer Science degree is helpful, but absolutely not a requirement. If you
build projects -- demonstrating that you can teach yourself new skills and
solve problems -- and are persistent with applications, you will get an
internship, I promise you!

With some effort and the guidelines in this book, you'll be easily able to
navigate the internship application process.
