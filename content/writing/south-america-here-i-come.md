I've been thinking a lot about fear, vulnerability and courage recently.

I've been very inspired by different writers who share with vulnerability.
I want to share with openness. I want to share both excitement and
ambition, and fear and challenge.

So here it goes. January 1st, 2015 I will no longer be employed. I have no
plans to do freelance work for the next five months. That very well might
classify me as unemployed. I am not sure at what point unemployment shifts
to self-employment, but I think the $30 I make per week from [ebook
sales](https://ecarmi.org/books/google-internship/) leaves me under the
cutoff.

Over the next five months I am hoping to change that. I want to invest my
time and energy in creating a few sources of revenue that will allow me
support myself independently.

I'll be travelling in Argentina and Chile in February and March and then
participating in Exosphere's [8-week entrepreneurship
bootcamp](http://exosphe.re/bootcamp). I'm planning to be in South America from
February to May.

> The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the
street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what
exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That’s the moment you
may be starting to get it right.
>
> – Neil Gaiman

As I make this life change and set out on a new adventure a fear of
failure accompanies me. This fear pushes me to hide myself and only share
if that which I'm sharing is a happy success story. I want to fight that
fear from the beginning, from right now, by sharing it.
