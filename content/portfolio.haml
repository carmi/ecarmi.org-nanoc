        [Brewster](https://www.brewster.com/) is [VC-backed](https://www.usv.com/portfolio) startup building the next-generation addressbook. As a Software Engineer within a small team I had numerous responsibilities including developing and managing multiple platforms. I was also the lead engineer on Brewster's syncing platform using CardDAV. CardDAV is a client/server protocol designed to allow syncing of contact information between a client and a server. I built the first version of a syncing solution that connected with Google's Contacts and Apple's iCloud services.
