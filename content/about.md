# Hey, I'm a software engineer and designer.


<img alt="I like headstands." id="headstand-about" src="/static/img/headstand-309x500.jpg">

I'm passionate about meaningful projects, thoughtful code and modal editors. My first entrance to technology was an apprenticeship with a computer consultant helping clients and small businesses. I built custom computers from scratch and setup software in a methodological process that emphasized serviceability. Eventually, my interests moved from building hardware to creating software. I began programming in Python and building web sites. In 2007 I wrote my first blog in [Django]. I started doing paid freelance programming soon after.

In 2008 Rob Hudson found me on [Django People](https://people.djangoproject.com/carmi/) and invited me to a Django Meetup. He also hired me for a contract job working in Django. A few years (and lots of code) later, I got an email out of the blue from The New York Times. This awesome fellow named Derek Willis was wondering if I'd be interested in working on The Times Interactive News team. Since then I've always been involved in a [project or a few](/portfolio/).

I'm majoring in Computer Science at [Wesleyan University](http://wesleyan.edu/). However, that hasn't stopped me from exploring a variety of subjects. In addition to my CS courses, I've studied three foreign languages, worked on a [Vandercook letterpress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandercook), made a book, and took a course titled *Acro-Yoga in the Age of Mechanicity*.
