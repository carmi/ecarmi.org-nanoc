# Introducing the Individual Coaching Program

I'm very exicted to introduce the Individual Coaching Program (ICP). I've helped people from all over the world with the internship process through my blog and [book](/books/google-internship/). However, the internship process is a personal persuit. You need to find the individual ways in which you can stand out from the crowd. I've received many emails and requests with additional questions specific to their personal situations.

The Individual Coaching Program is an individually tailored program to coach you along the internship application process. The program starts with a 45-minute video chat call. I will ask you questions about your current interests and ideal internships. I will then look over your current resume and website and provide advice on how to proceed during the application process. After our first video call I will be available to answer questions via email.


### The Individual Coaching Program costs $175.
