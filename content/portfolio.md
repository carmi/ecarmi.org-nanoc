* ##[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/)
  As an Interactive News Developer for The New York Times I worked on one of the web's best [London 2012 Olympics sites](http://london2012.nytimes.com/results).

  Contributed to a [schoolbook.org](http://www.schoolbook.org/), a site dedicated to news, data and conversation about schools in New York City.

* ##[Fech](https://github.com/NYTimes/Fech)
  Created the [first version of Fech](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/introducing-fech/), a Ruby parser for Federal Election Commission data while working on Campaign Finance apps at The New York Times. Our data was used to build [interactive](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/23/us/politics/20110723-romney-fundraising-map.html) [graphics](http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance/primaries).

* ##[wesleying.org](http://wesleying.org)
  Served as Chief Technology Mastermind for [wesleying.org](http://wesleying.org), a very popular blog about student life at Wesleyan University. While an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, I moved the WordPress site to a dedicated Linode VPS and optimized the server to handle increased traffic. I also completed a major redesign of the site in January 2013.
  
* ##[Sketchasong.com](http://sketchasong.com/)
  I developed a website and API to programmatically mix and create MP3 songs for Sketch-a-Song,an app to create songs with friends.

* ##[Program on Terrorism and Insurgency Research](https://ptir.du.edu/)
  Single handedly developed and deployed a custom Django web application to facilitate research, data entry, retrieval, and analysis for Professor Erica Chenoweth's Program on Terrorism and Insurgency Research.
