<article class='post'>
<p>Yesterday I woke up early in Manhattan. Well, early for a Saturday. This wasn’t the dreadful alarm-induced wake-up. Rather, I was pulled awake excited by the day to come.</p>

<p>Over the last years I’ve had a few large transitions in my life. These have always been marked by a plane flight. I get on a plane and end up somewhere very new, and very different. When I moved to Spain, and then to Connecticut, France, and New York, I always packed my bags, got on a plane, and started something new. I’ve also taken flights that are simply trips and don’t feel like long nostalgic voyages, but that’s besides the point.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got on a plane. This was a transitory flight. After my third summer in New York I was finally moving away. Yesterday I flew back to Oregon.</p>

<p>I was born and raised on a small Organic farm in rainy, beautiful Oregon, outside a town of about 10,000 people. There was exactly one high school – a small town kind of high school where punishment was centered around suspending people from their respective sports team. You see, if you failed your classes, or got caught with a beer, the dreaded penalty was always being forced to miss the upcoming game.</p>

<p>Yesterday I woke up in Manhattan, had brunch with a friend in a fancy French restaurant, did a few errands in SoHo, and then trekked to JFK Airport. Today I am in the small rural Oregon town where I grew up. For the last few years of my life it has often been back and forth from the fancy, cosmopolitan East Coast to a much shabbier Oregon.</p>

<p>However, yesterday’s plane flight was not of the visiting nature. It was the transitory kind, the kind that marks a new beginning.</p>

<p>After I graduated <a href="wesleyan.edu">college</a> I felt that having The New York Times on my <a href="/portfolio/">resume</a> should be enough to appease my ego and I should set out in pursuit of what I actually wanted to be doing, instead of simply working some job to demonstrate that I was smart and capable of getting some job, i.e. validating my ego. The only problem was I had no idea what I actually wanted to be doing.</p>

<p>A fortuitous rooftop encounter combined with doing well in French 101 led to a job offer that I wasn’t looking for. I didn’t want to live in New York, so I negotiated to work remote after a few months ramp-up. Despite having never met anyone at the company in person I signed some forms and accepted a job. A week later I was in New York.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’m moving to Portland. At first I’ll just crash with family, but then I’m planning to look for an apartment and settle down.</p>

<p>For so long I’ve been doing things in pre-established time chunks. Fours years of high scohool. One gap year. Four years of college. Three month summer jobs. Every part of my life – until now – has had a fixed completion date. I always knew when it would end.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, for the first time in my life I’m beginning something that does not have a fixed end. I’m moving to Portland and that’s it. I don’t have a goal, or a timeframe. I’m just going to try and create a life and see how it goes. Maybe I’ll spend three months and move on, or maybe three decades. Either way is fine.</p>
